## How to Run

To execute any of the scripts, use the following command in your terminal:

$ bash script-name.sh
```

Replace `script-name.sh` with the actual script name you want to run. Ensure that the file has executable permissions by running:

```bash
$ chmod +x script-name.sh
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have a Bash-compatible terminal installed.
